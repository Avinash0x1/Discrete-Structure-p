# Discrete Structure Programs

This repository contains C programs for discrete structure operations and truth tables.

## Programs Included

### 1. AND Operation
**File:** `C-program-to-print-truth-table-of-AND-Operation.c`
- Prints truth table for logical AND operation
- Shows results for A ∧ B

### 2. OR Operation
**File:** `program-to-print-truth-table-of-OR-Operation.c`
- Prints truth table for logical OR operation
- Shows results for A ∨ B

### 3. NOT Operation
**File:** `program-to-print-truth-table-of-NOT-operation.c`
- Prints truth table for logical NOT operation
- Shows results for ~A

### 4. IMPLICATION Operation
**File:** `program-to-print-truth-table-of-IMPLICION-Operation.c`
- Prints truth table for logical IMPLICATION operation
- Shows results for A → B

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile:**
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output.exe
   ```

2. **Run:**
   ```bash
   ./output.exe
   ```

## Truth Tables

### AND Operation (A ∧ B)
| A | B | A ∧ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |   1   |

### OR Operation (A ∨ B)
| A | B | A ∨ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |   1   |

### NOT Operation (~A)
| A | ~A |
|---|----| 
| 0 |  1 |
| 1 |  0 |

### IMPLICATION Operation (A → B)
| A | B | A → B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   1   |
| 0 | 1 |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |   1   |
